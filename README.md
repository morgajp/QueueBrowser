# QueueBrowser
This is a utility to make using Amazon's Simple Queue Service (SQS) a little less painful, hopefully.  I just get tired of logging in all the time, especially with multiple accounts, and the filtering kind of sucks.

This will pull profile info from your .aws/credentials file, it assumes you have at least a [default] profile defined.  This will run on windows or linux with python3.  The only dependency you will need is boto3.

Still very much a work in progress.
